            Our first stay at Moxy poop, our first dayuse, that time we got into an accident in the uber poop and were stressing, I loved this day poop, I love spending time with you, <br><br> Look at us both in this bathroom poop, the lighting, the vibe of the room, everything was so perfect, but none of it came close to the company I had around me. <br> <br> That's you darling. <br><br> From the minute we met poop, I had my eyes set on you, I knew it was you from the start and that it would always be you.
